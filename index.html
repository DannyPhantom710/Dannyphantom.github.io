        <div class="paragraph-one">
        <p>The love you have shown me is unforgettable, and beyond comprehension. For me to find a woman as amazing as you in this era is unimaginable, and it brings me absolute joy and happiness to know that I found you and was able to find love when I least expected it. I want to thank you for always being by my side and for always choosing me in good and bad times. My love for you can only be described by the words of God and only he can tell you how much you mean to me.
            I love you Seara Xaria Menzie!!!
